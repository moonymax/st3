# My SolidStart Starter Template

This project is my custom ***SolidStart*** starter project. It has a full **Auth** flow complete with email verification.

## User Convenience

I am using ***nodemailer*** to send a verification email with a token that can satisfy the challenge created by the server.
The entire process is password less for user convenience.

## Improvements

In future **Authentication** will be done using ***Auth.js***.
